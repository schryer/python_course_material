# Learning goals for `extra_topics`

The `.ipynb` files in this directory (`extra_topics`) allow newcomers to scientific programming
to learn the basic skills to be self-sufficient learners.  All data files can be found in the `data` directory
contained in `extra_topics`.

- It is recommended that learners start with `biopython.ipynb` because this is aimed at teaching
  how to use *API* documentation (application programming interface).

- The custom table used in `biopython.ipynb` is explained further in `tables.ipynb`, but only curious
  readers should look at this file.

- `numpy.ipynb` provides a short introduction to numpy with plotting
functions and solving a linear system. 

A number of notebooks do not require any previous knowledge and can be explored at any time:

- `sympy.ipynb` provides a short introduction to sympy

- `sets.ipynb` introduces Python sets and uses a concept map to help in the learning process.

Two notebooks provide different methods to read in data from external files:

- `exploring_data.ipynb` introduces a thought process one can use to explore new data for the first time.
  It briefly uses the `pandas` library and introduces plotting using `matplotlib`.

- `proteomics_data.ipynb` uses the `pandas` library to read in and manipulate proteomics data.
  This module also introduces plotting using `matplotlib`.

Two notebooks introduce advanced topics in scientific computation with simple examples:

- `kinetics.ipynb` demonstrates how to solve ordinary differential equations and plot the results.

- `fitting_a_function_to_data.ipynb` demonstrates how to fit a function to experimental data and plot the results.
